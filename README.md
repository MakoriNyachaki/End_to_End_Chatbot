# End-to-End Chatbot

_End-to-End chatbot is a tool that holds a converation from the start to end without any human assistance._

The program involves writing a computer program that can understand user requestand generate responses as per the requests.
The whole process involves:

- Collecting data

* Choosing a programming language and NLP.

* Training the chatbot.

* Testing and refining the application.

* Making it available to te users.


Once deployed the user can interract with the chatbot by sending it multiple requests and it can handle the entire conversation.


### _Steps to follow in creating the entire chatbot_


* Define intents; add more intents to make the chatbot more functional and helpful

* Train the chatbot; using a learning model train the chatbot.

* Build the chatbot

* Test the chatbot

* Deploy the chatbot

### Deployment

After building the chatbot, write a python function to test the chatbot.
To deploy the chatboat we will use the _streamlit_ library in Python which provides amazing features to create  a user interface for a Machine Learning application with few lines of code. The main() function deploys the model as illustrated in the code.


_To run the chatbot, use the following command:_


'''streamlit run filename.py'''                        

After executing the code an interface to caht with the bot is displayed.
